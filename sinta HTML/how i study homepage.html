         <p>Just trying to get knowleged so i can run things someday. just here trying to learn how to code,using some channels on youtube.... I know sometimes it seems impossible but i believe one day i will get to insper other girls to do the same. By <b>God's</b> grace.</p> 
         <p>so now the first step is to learn how this bad boy works.that is learning to how to code and stuff like that. hopefully i get the basics i can be abel to figure out to programm and design some things. but i will like to mater in AI technology actually so yaa....., why am i tying all this? i don't even know maybe its cause is part of the vision someone said i am putting in to much human effort but really i just want to know i put in my best not leaving any stone unturned. then let God do the rest.</p>
